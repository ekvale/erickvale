## Coding Guidelines

### Segment Identification
1. **Meaningful segments**: Code passages that contain significant thematic, narrative, or symbolic content
2. **Length**: Segments should be complete thoughts or scenes (typically 50-500 characters)
3. **Overlap allowed**: Segments can overlap if they contain different codes
4. **Multiple codes**: Apply all relevant codes to each segment (typically 1-5 codes per segment)

### Code Application Principles
1. **Be specific**: Use the most specific code available (e.g., use KID instead of CHARACTER if the Kid is mentioned)
2. **Multiple codes**: Apply multiple codes when a segment contains multiple themes
3. **Context matters**: Consider the broader context of the passage
4. **Symbolic vs. literal**: Code both literal descriptions and symbolic meanings
5. **Process codes**: Use process codes for actions and transformations
6. **Emotion codes**: Code emotional content explicitly described or strongly implied

### Output Format

Provide your coded segments as a JSON array. Each segment should have:

```json
{
  "text": "The exact text excerpt from the source",
  "location": "Descriptive location (e.g., 'Chapter 1, Page 5' or 'Section 2, lines 100-150')",
  "codes": ["CODE_NAME_1", "CODE_NAME_2", "CODE_NAME_3"],
  "memo": "Brief analytical note about why these codes apply (optional but helpful)"
}
```

### Example Output

```json
[
  {
    "text": "to wound the autumnal city.\nSo howled out for the world to give him a name.\nThe in-dark answered with wind.",
    "location": "Opening, lines 1-3",
    "codes": ["CIRCULAR_STRUCTURE", "BELLONA_CITY", "SPATIAL_DISORIENTATION"],
    "memo": "Opening establishes circular structure and introduces Bellona as setting with disorienting imagery"
  },
  {
    "text": "The Kid wandered through the ruins, notebook in hand, searching for something he couldn't name.",
    "location": "Chapter 1, Section 2",
    "codes": ["KID", "WANDERING", "URBAN_DECAY", "NOTEBOOK", "SEARCHING", "NAME_AMNESIA"],
    "memo": "Protagonist's aimless movement through decay, carrying notebook, searching for identity"
  }
]
```

## Instructions for Processing

1. **Read the full text** of Dhalgren carefully
2. **Identify segments** that contain significant content matching the codebook
3. **Apply codes** based on the definitions provided
4. **Create location markers** that help identify where segments appear (chapter, section, page, or character position)
5. **Write brief memos** explaining the code application when helpful
6. **Output as JSON** in the format specified above

## Important Notes

- **Character positions**: If you have access to character positions (start_pos, end_pos), include them in the location field
- **Code names**: Use EXACT code names as listed above (case-sensitive, with underscores)
- **Multiple codes**: It's common for segments to have 2-5 codes
- **Completeness**: Aim to code significant passages throughout the entire text, not just highlights
- **Quality over quantity**: Better to have fewer, well-coded segments than many poorly coded ones

## Output Requirements

- Format: Valid JSON array
- Encoding: UTF-8
- Structure: Array of segment objects as shown above
- Completeness: Code meaningful passages throughout the text
- Accuracy: Ensure code names match exactly (case-sensitive)
